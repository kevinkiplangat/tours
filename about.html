        <h2>OUR VISION</h2>
        To be the giraffes in the tourism industry by standing tall to see far on behalf of  our clients before others do and advising clients accordingly by packaging holiday deals at unbelievable prices!

        <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
        W are so passionate on what we do…therefore our mission is divided into four categories:

        <h2>CLIENT MISSION</h2>
        We are dedicated to offering the highest quality, safest and best value trips that we can. But on top of offering an excellent product, we are also committed to making a positive change in the lives of our clients. We at Bonfire Adventures have all benefited in meaningful ways from the remarkable power of having a passion in life; of having a pastime that brings you pleasure, friendships, a sense of achievement and a total escape from the pressures of everyday life. Some of us have found self-confidence, others friendships, and others motivation and drive as a result of our involvement in sports. We want our clients to also experience the pleasure of finding and pursuing a passion. It is our goal that clients return from our trips having found a new passion or solidified an existing one, having made lasting friendships, having experienced a deep sense of achievement as a result of reaching new heights in their favorite sport, and having acquired a new perspective on life as a result of the unique experiences that our trips provide. We have had more than a few clients who have returned from our trips and decided to make major life changes such as changing careers to pursue more meaningful work, moving countries to be closer to the tours s, and changing universities to be around more like-minded people. We do not expect our trips to have such a dramatic impact on all our clients, but we do hope that all our clients can be inspired in some small way from the experience of sharing their passion with us. Please feel free to join our members club and enjoy great benefits on future getaways!

        <h2>EMPLOYEES MISSION</h2>
        Traditionally, members of the travel and tours  industries; guides, leaders and instructors, are paid very low wages despite the difficult and skilled work they carry out. We at Bonfire Adventures  understand that our company would be nothing without the hard work, enthusiasm and skill of our talented trip leaders, trip developers, guides, instructors and other employees and it is our desire to reward our team members for their effort. For this reason, not only do we pay generous wages that exceed industry averages, but we also provide significant profit share and bonus schemes to ensure our employees directly benefit from their excellent work. We also give our employees significant freedom to create, run and manage our trips so that they feel a sense of ownership over the trips they lead and we involve them as much as possible in the strategic development of our company so that they feel a part of a common vision. It is our goal to become the employer of choice in the tours and travel industries and to be recognized by our team members as a generous, inspiring, and great place to work. We hope to contribute to our employees’ lives by allowing them to pursue their passion for travel and the tours s while still being able to make a comfortable living. Please feel free to tip the tour guides for a job well done after the safari.

        <h2>SOCIAL MISSION</h2>

        By the very fact that it brings together people from all different cultures and backgrounds, travel has an enormous power to unite and improve people’s understanding of each other. It also has great potential to improve the economic welfare of the world’s poorest populations by providing new sources of income. Without careful monitoring, however, tourism also has great power to inflict negative change upon the world by creating ecological damage, uprooting communities, and perpetuating cultural stereotypes as a result of close-minded and culturally insensitive travelers. We seek to maximize the positive impact of our trips on the local communities we visit and eliminate potential negative effects. In addition to involving local people in our trips, we try to meet this goal by creating itineraries that allow clients to experience the local culture through food, festivals, activities and cultural sites. Please feel free to donate to them if you identify any needs they might have you may contact us on how to go about it.

        <h2>ENVIRONMENTAL MISSION</h2>
        It is our mission to serve as beacons for those who want to preserve what is left for generations to come. In our simple way, we ask that you come join us on a journey to discover the subtle treasures of Kenya. In doing so, it will awaken you to all the rich historical, cultural and natural resources that she offers.

        To minimize our impact on the environments we follow the principles of a non-profit organization that is dedicated to promoting and inspiring responsible tours recreation. These principles include:

        1. Plan ahead and prepare
        2. Travel and camp on durable surfaces
        3. Dispose of waste properly
        4. Leave what you find
        5. Minimize camp fire impacts
        6. Respect wildlife
        7. Be considerate of other visitors

        In addition to following the principles, we minimize the impact of our trips by keeping our group sizes small and educating and informing our clients about the regions we visit to increase their interest in and appreciation for the environment.

        To ensure that we not only eliminate our negative impact upon the environment but also contribute to positive environmental change, we also donate 1% of our total annual profits to several environmental companies in Kenya that they can further their valuable efforts to plant trees, conserve environment, build awareness, appreciation and respect for worlds mother nature. Please feel free to contact us on how you can get involved.</p>
